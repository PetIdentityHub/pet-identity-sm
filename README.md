## ‚ùì What is Pet Identity Hub

<b>Pet Identity Hub </b> is a project that aims to explore and demonstrate the potential of creating digital identities for pets. The primary objective of this project is:

- to provide a comprehensive infrastructure for the PetTech industry,
- enabling the creation, management, and utilization of digital profiles for:
  - any pet,
  - any institution.

The solution will offer a wide range of functionalities, empowering pet owners and businesses alike to interact with digital pet profiles seamlessly.

<b>Pet Identity Hub</b> will include a suite of decentralized applications (dApps) that facilitate the creation and display of pet profiles, the establishment and management of institution profiles, and the issuance of digital certificates or proofs, referred to as <b>Piecie</b>.

As an infrastructure project, <b>Pet Identity Hub</b> will offer a robust <b>API</b> for PetTech developers, allowing them to integrate digital pet profiles into their own solutions. This seamless integration will enable developers to leverage the platform's capabilities and streamline pet-related services, resulting in improved user experiences for both pet owners and service providers.

To ensure the success and widespread adoption of the platform, the project will focus on fostering a collaborative ecosystem among pet owners, service providers, and developers. By creating a secure, user-friendly, and scalable platform, Pet Identity Hub aims to revolutionize the PetTech industry and pave the way for a more connected and efficient pet-centric world.

## ‚ùì Do we really need that

Yes, we believe that this kind infrastructure is really needed in our society. Currently solutions are extremely inefficient and outdated.ü•∂ We would say more, there is not widely recognized standard and we want to change this.üöÄ

<i>A few example what we mean:</i>

- <b>Vets</b> are real magicians for our beloved pets but most of the times they use old tools to cast their spelling! When we go to vet they care about health our pet, but what happened next? Well, it depends on country but probably the most often case is they put pet data in old system, without external access to database, and rewrite it on pet paper document. We don't have direct access to our pet data and we go back home with paper document (yeeh, more papers at home). Another problem is when we change our vet. They could not have all necessary medical history of our lovely one. There is not standard central database from which pet system could get necessary data. Ok, let's go deeper. We are moving abroad. We don't have digital data, but we have paper document (if we not lose it at this point) but in national language. Fill the problems? So, would be great have one universal, standard profile with medical record in database? We believe yes, and answer is our solution based on blockchain.
- <b>Breeders</b>
- <b>Organizers of the competitions</b> guard the distinction and awarding of the best animals in various categories. Do you ever think how it look like? We know. A lot of paper and handwriting. What happen when our pet win? Well, we are getting diploma for winning. Now, when you want to prove that your pet won something it is time to get diplomas from wall. If you use a lot of this, for some reason, we guess you could approve this activity as cardio exercise. What is we could have a digital prove which connected with our unique pet profile? Sounds comfy and <b>Pet Identity Hub</b> have it! Beyond proof from professional perspective it will be also much easier to show off to friends what a wonderful pet we have.
- <b>Social media</b>, SHOW MUST GO ON! Yes, we heard that social media is evil, but for a reason we still put our the best moment of life on our social media wall instead just invite a few friends. We believe digital profile could connect this the best photo or videos <s>(and memes)</s> on different social platform. We proud of our pet, don't we?

...more, more, and more. We could write more about problem we see that project could solve but this is just readme file, not a whole book!
