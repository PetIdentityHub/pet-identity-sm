## ‚ùì What is Pet Identity Hub

<b>Pet Identity Hub </b> is a project that aims to explore and demonstrate the potential of creating digital identities for pets. The primary objective of this project is:

- to provide a comprehensive infrastructure for the PetTech industry,
- enabling the creation, management, and utilization of digital profiles for:
  - any pet,
  - any institution.

The solution will offer a wide range of functionalities, empowering pet owners and businesses alike to interact with digital pet profiles seamlessly.

<b>Pet Identity Hub</b> will include a suite of decentralized applications (dApps) that facilitate the creation and display of pet profiles, the establishment and management of institution profiles, and the issuance of digital certificates or proofs, referred to as <b>Piecie</b>.

As an infrastructure project, <b>Pet Identity Hub</b> will offer a robust <b>API</b> for PetTech developers, allowing them to integrate digital pet profiles into their own solutions. This seamless integration will enable developers to leverage the platform's capabilities and streamline pet-related services, resulting in improved user experiences for both pet owners and service providers.

To ensure the success and widespread adoption of the platform, the project will focus on fostering a collaborative ecosystem among pet owners, service providers, and developers. By creating a secure, user-friendly, and scalable platform, Pet Identity Hub aims to revolutionize the PetTech industry and pave the way for a more connected and efficient pet-centric world.

## ‚ùì Do we really need that

Yes, we believe that this kind infrastructure is really needed in our society. Currently solutions are extremely inefficient and outdated.ü•∂ We would say more, there is not widely recognized standard and we want to change this.üöÄ

<i>A few example what we mean:</i>

- <b>Vets</b> are real magicians for our beloved pets but most of the times they use old tools to cast their spelling! When we go to vet they care about health our pet, but what happened next? Well, it depends on country but probably the most often case is they put pet data in old system, without external access to database, and rewrite it on pet paper document. We don't have direct access to our pet data and we go back home with paper document (yeeh, more papers at home). Another problem is when we change our vet. They could not have all necessary medical history of our lovely one. There is not standard central database from which pet system could get necessary data. Ok, let's go deeper. We are moving abroad. We don't have digital data, but we have paper document (if we not lose it at this point) but in national language. Fill the problems? So, would be great have one universal, standard profile with medical record in database? We believe yes, and answer is our solution based on blockchain.
- <b>Breeders</b>, imagine a litter of newborn puppies or kittens. Amidst the excitement, breeders are swamped with paperwork. Birth certificates, family trees, tracking each newborn, and monitoring their health - it's an avalanche of information to manage.
  Enter our technology, designed to revolutionize breeders' operations. Imagine issuing digital birth certificates, maintaining up-to-date family trees, and tracking every pet born under your care, all stored in their unique profiles. Plus, having crucial health data at your fingertips, guiding future breeding decisions for healthier pets.
  In short, we're providing breeders with digital tools to make their important work simpler, more efficient, and ultimately, more impactful. We're here to help breeders focus on what they love most - bringing healthier, happier pets into our lives.
- <b>Organizers of the competitions</b> guard the distinction and awarding of the best animals in various categories. Do you ever think how it look like? We know. A lot of paper and handwriting. What happen when our pet win? Well, we are getting diploma for winning. Now, when you want to prove that your pet won something it is time to get diplomas from wall. If you use a lot of this, for some reason, we guess you could approve this activity as cardio exercise. What is we could have a digital prove which connected with our unique pet profile? Sounds comfy and <b>Pet Identity Hub</b> have it! Beyond proof from professional perspective it will be also much easier to show off to friends what a wonderful pet we have.
- <b>Social media</b>, SHOW MUST GO ON! Yes, we heard that social media is evil, but for a reason we still put our the best moment of life on our social media wall instead just invite a few friends. We believe digital profile could connect this the best photo or videos <s>(and memes)</s> on different social platform. We proud of our pet, don't we?

...more, more, and more. We could write more about problem we see that project could solve but this is just readme file, not a whole book!

## ‚ùì How do we solve that problems

When we split problems into smaller step and unified them then we see we have to find solution to this tree assumptions:

1. We need something unique what pets have to connect with unique digital profile.
2. Digital identity has to be unique.
3. Solution have to be centralize infrastructure open for other developer with unified database. This could help to create formal accepted standard.

We believe we found answers.

Pet could have physics chip with unique ID. In some formal cases it is necessary but in generally it is really useful to have one. This solve our first assumption how to connect pet with unique digital profile.

Looking for solution for second assumption we believe that blockchain is answer for this. In this context we could see this as RWA and leverage properties of blockchain to achieve unique digital identity by NFT or SBT.

Last but not least is build smart contract protocols wrapped by API which make Pet Identity Hub more accessible for other project. Project could have two ways to connect with our protocol:

- Using direct our smart contract or,
- Using protocol by API.

## üí∞ Market size

It is really hard to estimate potential market size. When we looking for analytics reports it is possible to found pet Id microchips market or pet tech market. Most of the report have put Digital Identity Solution together but this notion is much broader than our case.

For Pet tech and according to Global Market Insights, the global pet tech market size was $5 billion in 2022. Predict expansion of as much as 15% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) from 2023 to 2032.

In case of pet id microchips market size according to The Insights Partners the industry is projected to reach US$111,35 million by 2028 from US$ 79.53 million in 2022. It is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.8% 2022-2028.

We believe, on our personal experience and when we try to find reliable reports, that our solution is operate in Blue Ocean Strategy. We try to create a new demand and new market place.

## üß≠ Roadmap

- Develop smart contract for concepts: PetProfile, PieceIssuer, Piece. Base concept of our solution could evolve but it's fundament for building.
- Develop web platform.
  - Create pet profile,
  - Search and show pet profile,
  - Operator dashboard,
  - Apply and create Piece Issuer Profile,
  - Piece Issuer dashboard,
  - Listing and claim PieceNFT
- Create API and documentation to other PetTech industry developers,
- Concept and develop smart contract middleware with engine,
- Concept and develop middleware for monetize API usage,
- Create plug-and-play frontend component for authorization,
- Release alpha, connect with industry, get feedback.

## üöÄ Goals and development directions

Our ultimate goal with this solution is to make a new standard in the industry. We want our protocol to either replace or add to existing rules, like the EU Pet Passport. It's a big goal, but we all share one thing: we love our pets and nature.

A smaller goal is to help find lost pets. Right now, people use social media or special websites to search for their lost pets. The problem is, there are so many social groups and only a few websites to check if someone found our pet. Also, if you find a pet and want to find its owner, it's hard to know where to start.

We think we can make a mobile app that connects to our Pet Identity Hub protocol. This app could use artificial intelligence to recognize pets and guess if it's the right one. We could also use NFC technology to read a pet's microchip and get its ID, which we can check with our protocol.

## ‚ùó <u>GEEK ALERT - TECH</u> ‚ùó

Ok, last but not least, time to say a little about our technology.

- A core business logic is smart contracts (Solidity),
- Frontend will use Angular and React with Federation Module,
- Backend will provide API for other developer and played the role help infrastructure for Pet Identity Hub Web (NodeJS/.NET)
